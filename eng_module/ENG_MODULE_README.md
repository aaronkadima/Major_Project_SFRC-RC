When you are ready to submit, copy the following files from your personal `eng_module` repo into this "eng_module" sub-directory:

- beams.py
- test_beams.py
- test_data/ (i.e. copy over your entire test_data directory)

By copying the _contents_ of your `eng_module` repo, we avoid the problem of copying that hidden ".git" folder and having to delete it after copying.
